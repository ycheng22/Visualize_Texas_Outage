# Visualize_Texas_Outage

**Description**: 

I want to visualize the Texas power outage during Feb.10 to Feb.19 hour by hour in Tableau.
* Firstly, collecting outage data, weather history data and Texas county data.
* Secondly, processing the data.
* Lastly, visualizing the processed data in Tableau or visualizing data by Plotly in Notebook.
